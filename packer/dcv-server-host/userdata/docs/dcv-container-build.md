This script is designed to build a Docker container for an application using NICE DCV (Display Control and Virtualization) server software. Here's what it does:

### Script Breakdown:

1. **Logging Setup**:
   - Defines a `log` function to timestamp and log messages to `/var/log/userdata.log` with root privileges.

2. **Directory Change**:
   - Changes the directory to `/opt/dcv`, where the Dockerfile for the DCV container presumably resides.

3. **User Group Addition**:
   - Adds the current user (`$MY_USER`, which is determined by `whoami`) to the `docker` group. This allows the user to run Docker commands without needing `sudo`.
   - Executes `newgrp docker` to apply the group change immediately for the current session.

4. **Docker Build**:
   - Builds a Docker image named `intraverse-dcv-server` from the Dockerfile in the current directory.

### Key Points:

- **Automation**: This script automates the process of setting up permissions and building the Docker image, which is crucial for continuous integration/deployment pipelines or for setting up environments where users might not have superuser privileges.

- **Security**: Adding the user to the `docker` group instead of running Docker commands with `sudo` is a common practice for security and ease of use in development environments.

- **Docker Build**: The `docker build` command constructs the Docker image. The Dockerfile (not shown in this script) would contain instructions on how to assemble the image, including installing dependencies, setting up the DCV server, and configuring any necessary environment variables or settings for the DCV service.

- **Error Handling**: The `set -e` at the beginning ensures the script exits if any command fails, though specific error messages or recovery actions are not detailed in the script beyond what `set -e` provides.

### Considerations:

- **Script Execution**: This script should be run by a user with appropriate permissions to modify group memberships, which typically means it needs to be run with sudo or by a user with sudo privileges initially to add themselves to the `docker` group.

- **Docker Daemon**: Ensure the Docker daemon is running, and there's sufficient disk space for building Docker images.

- **Dockerfile Content**: The effectiveness of this script relies heavily on what's in the Dockerfile. Ensure this contains all necessary steps for setting up the DCV environment, including any NVIDIA drivers or GPU configurations if applicable.

- **Security**: While adding to the `docker` group simplifies usage, it's a security consideration. Ensure this is necessary and review Docker's security best practices.

- **Logging**: Logging to `/var/log/userdata.log` with sudo can be useful for tracking, but ensure log rotation or management is in place to prevent log file growth issues.

This script provides a streamlined approach for building a DCV server Docker container, tailored for environments where automated setup or deployment is required.
