# Docs

While confluence is a great place to publish well-formatted and organized documents, I find that having a designated place for quick Markdown docs ends up encouraging overall better documentation habits. This is especially true now that you can dump your rough draft into an LLM and have it spit out docs worth publishing to the official wiki.

I've even started keeping a raw log of development notes that would be too messy to be useful in the past but as local private GPTs become more powerful and efficient, these types of docs are much more searchable since they are basically conversational now.
