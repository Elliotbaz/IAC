## Securing the Root AWS Account
The root user of the management account for our AWS organization is owned by James. It it assigned to his email `james@terrazero.com` and is not secured with MFA. We are going to change probably all of that. Yesterday, Brandon got James to reset the root password and provide us with access to the root user of the management account. 

### Changing the Root User Email
1. Log in to the Billing and Cost Management console as the root user. From the drop list at the right side of the top bar, select "Account".
2. Select Edit next to Account Settings
3. Select Edit for the email address
4. Enter the new email address and confirm it
5. Confirm the current password
6. Select Save changes
7. A verification code will be sent to the new email address
8. Enter the verification code on the Verify your new email address page
9. Select Save changes

### Adding an Email in Google Workspaces
1. Go to admin.google.com. 
2. Log in as a manager.
3. Go to Apps -> Google Workspace -> Gmail
4. Scroll down to the "Routing" section and expand it
5. Scroll down to "Email forwarding using recipient address map"
6. Click "ADD ANOTHER RULE"
7. Add a description for the forwarding rule. For example, "Email for the management account for the TerraZero AWS Organization."
8. In the "Address" field, using a standard and descriptive naming convention, add the address name. For example, you would want the root user email of the aws management account to be something like `aws-management@terrazero.com`.
9. Click on the "Map to address" field. A dropdown of available users will populate. Select the user or group that you want to receive mail for this email address. 
 
> **About Google Workspace groups and email naming conventions:** It will be best to decide on a naming convention that is descriptive and easy to read, understand and organize. If an email address is responsible for an aws account, it should have `aws` in the name as well as something descriptive relating to the account name. For example, if it is the email for the root user of the management account for the organzation, the email would be `aws-management@terrazero.com`. Then the dev email would ideally be something like `aws-dev@terrazero.com`. Then if we went to add a new account for secure backups, it would be something like `aws-backups@terrazero.com`. Then SecOps would be `aws-secops@terrazero.com` and so on.

### Root User Email Addresses

| Email Address              | Account Name      | Account Number | Description                           |
|----------------------------|-------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------|
| james@terrazero.com | terrazero | 097157727296   | Management account of the TerraZero AWS Organization |
| webhosting@terrazero.com | TerraZero_Dev | 585415957264 | Development account |
| mike+demo@terrazero.com | Demo | 339712848990 | Mike's demo account |
| prod-services@terrazero.com | TerraZero_Prod | 189846331552 | Prod account | 
| webhostingQA@terrazero.com | TerraZero_QA | 602161100705 | QA Account |


While all of these emails are at least under the same domain, there doesn't appear to be much descriptiveness or standardization of the email addresses. This isn't a serious problem, but while we're making changes and likely anticipating multiple additional AWS accounts in the future, now would be a good time to create a policy stating an agreed-upon naming convention.

Here is an exmaple of such a policy:

### Naming Convention Policy for AWS Account Email Addresses

To ensure consistency and clarity in managing AWS accounts within the TerraZero organization, the following naming convention policy is established:

1. All email addresses associated with AWS accounts should follow the format: `[service]-[account-name]@terrazero.com`.

    - `[service]` represents the specific AWS service or account type.
    - `[account-name]` provides a descriptive name for the account.

    For example, the root user email address for the management account should be `aws-management@terrazero.com`, and the email address for the development account should be `aws-dev@terrazero.com`.

2. The naming convention should be applied to all existing and future AWS accounts within the organization.

3. The purpose of each AWS account should be reflected in the account name to facilitate easy identification and organization.

4. The naming convention should be consistently followed by all team members involved in managing AWS accounts.

By adhering to this naming convention policy, we can ensure clear communication, easy identification, and efficient management of AWS accounts within the TerraZero organization.

## Using a Virtual MFA Device
To set up a virtual MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) device using Authy, you'll need to follow these general steps:

1. **Install Authy**: Start by downloading and installing the Authy app on your device. It's available for iOS, Android, and desktop platforms.

2. **Register an Account**: If you haven't already, create an Authy account. You'll need to provide your phone number and email address to register.

3. **Add an Account**: Once logged in, you'll need to add the service or account for which you want to set up MFA. Look for the option to add a new account or service within the Authy app.

4. **Select "Virtual Device"**: During the setup process, you'll typically be given the option to choose between a physical MFA device (like a hardware token) or a virtual device. Select the virtual device option.

5. **Scan QR Code or Enter Secret Key**: The service you're setting up MFA for will usually provide a QR code or a secret key. Use Authy to scan the QR code or manually enter the secret key into the app.

6. **Verify Setup**: Once the QR code is scanned or the secret key is entered, Authy will generate a one-time passcode (OTP). Enter this code into the service's website to verify that the setup was successful.

7. **Backup Codes (Optional)**: Some services will provide backup codes in case you lose access to your MFA device. Make sure to store these codes in a secure place, as they can be used to regain access to your accounts if you lose your MFA device.

8. **Enable MFA**: After setting up Authy as your virtual MFA device, make sure to enable MFA within the settings of the service or account you're securing. This usually involves going into your account settings, finding the MFA or security section, and enabling MFA using the Authy-generated codes.

Remember to keep your Authy app updated and secure, as it holds the keys to your MFA-protected accounts.

## Enabling MFA

1. Log into the AWS console as the root user.
2. From the drop list at the right side of the top bar, select "Security Credentials".
3. Verify that there are no entries under the "Access Keys" section.
4. After making sure that no keys exist to verify that no services are authenticating ast he root user, you may now enable MFA without disrupting services.
5. Under the "Muli-factor authentication (MFA)" section, click "Assign MFA Device"
7. Select "Authenticator app"
