### [Executive Summary: Cloud Game Streaming Investigation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YoAUBxHqvIB0407sq-E9jYlu4G0-sJAi1mLS43oJnB4/edit)

**Background:**

TerraZero aimed to explore cost-effective and performance-enhancing methods for Cloud Game Streaming, with a goal of maintaining costs below $0.027 USD per minute while improving performance and gaining greater control over infrastructure and software components. The preferred approach was to implement this through a web browser client.

**Investigation:**

After evaluating different Cloud Streaming Options, the focus narrowed down to Screen Scraping (Appstream, Parsec, etc) and Pixel Streaming. The decision was made to pursue Pixel Streaming (POC - Unity Render Streaming.doc) due to anticipated improvements in performance, interactivity, and cost compared to the current Screen Scraping method.

**Deployment:**

*Updating Build:*
The Unity Render Streaming package was implemented in the game (POC - Teddy Swims.doc), incorporating changes for browser-controlled input, streaming optimization, and performance testing. The deployment to AWS involved selecting EC2 instance types, configuring networking, and utilizing Nvidia drivers.

*AWS Deployment:*
The deployment to AWS was done with a simplified architecture to test feasibility and performance.

**Test Results:**

Successful render streaming from the server to the client browser was observed, with two concurrent gaming sessions per machine performing without noticeable degradation or frame drops. Key metrics included a resolution of 720p, approximately 30 FPS, encoding using H264, and a bitrate between (3500,6000 kbits/sec).

**Not tested:**

Mobile controls

**Pricing:**

Comparison of server costs indicates potential savings of approximately 52.59% to 81.98%, depending on session utilization and operating system (Windows/Linux). However, operational costs and development efforts were not factored into the assessment, and TerraZero would need to handle all operational and development aspects if pursued independently.

**Development Effort:**

Significant development efforts would be required, including modifying the application for render streaming, implementing touch controls, creating an orchestration layer, developing a front-end UI, implementing a deployment pipeline, and ongoing maintenance tasks.

**Risks:**

Implementing this project entails inherent risks, including the novelty of render streaming technology, potential development challenges, and the possibility of increased costs as more details about the application and architecture emerge. Additionally, reliance on a SaaS provider offers continuous updates, a benefit not realized when managing the platform independently.

**Conclusion:**

While potential cost savings are significant, careful consideration of operational responsibilities, development efforts, and associated risks is crucial before committing to a full-scale implementation of render streaming technology. Further analysis of pursuing screen scraping technology may decrease the level of risk/effort associated with implementing pixel streaming while still providing a cost benefit.

### [TerraZero Cloud Streaming Research](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18fenQxVXCp_lYTkpV8Si9OCWplECk0gMukbBo54T4pE/edit#heading=h.ko6h5aauj7vt)

It seems like you're embarking on an ambitious journey into the realm of cloud gaming, with a particular focus on Unity app streaming. Let's break down some key points and considerations based on the information you've provided:

### Goals and Objectives:
- **Proof of Concept (POC):** Your primary aim is to validate the feasibility of cloud streaming for Unity apps, ensuring compatibility across desktop and mobile platforms.
- **Cost-effectiveness:** You're striving for a pricing structure that outperforms existing market rates, particularly targeting a lower cost than $0.027 USD per minute charged by Vagon.

### Research Insights:
- **Cloud Gaming Platforms:** Analyzing big players like Stadia, GeForce Now, and PSNow provides valuable insights into underlying technologies and protocols, such as WebRTC for browser-based streaming.
- **Existing Solutions:** Platforms like Steam Remote Play and Parsec offer functionalities for remote gaming, but may not align perfectly with TerraZero's goals due to limitations or focus on different user bases.

### Technical Considerations:
- **Streaming Protocols:** Understanding protocols like WebRTC, NICE DCV, and proprietary solutions like BUD (Parsec) is crucial for selecting the most suitable technology stack.
- **Hosting Options:** AWS AppStream, Moonlight, and Unity Render Streaming offer diverse approaches to cloud hosting and streaming, each with its own strengths and limitations.
- **Integration with Unity:** Unity Render Streaming presents an intriguing option for integrating cloud streaming directly into Unity apps, leveraging Unity's built-in RTC server.

### Comparative Analysis:
- **AWS Services:** AppStream, Workspaces, and EC2 each offer unique features and pricing models, necessitating a careful comparison to determine the best fit for TerraZero's requirements.
- **Game Streaming Protocols:** Evaluating protocols like NICE DCV, WebRTC, and PCoIP helps in understanding their performance and compatibility with TerraZero's objectives.

### Additional Resources:
- **Community Insights:** Leveraging resources like forums, blog posts, and LinkedIn discussions can provide valuable insights and practical advice from industry experts and practitioners.

By synthesizing these research findings and technical insights, you can develop a robust strategy for implementing cloud streaming for TerraZero's Unity app, keeping in mind the overarching goals of cost-effectiveness, compatibility, and seamless user experience across platforms.

### [AWS AppStream 2.0 - Custom Hosting on EC2 - Workspaces](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ftp4DBXEqTKjokTCggPc73vXWVdDHtXL0ioLq6AjzsY/edit#heading=h.8nfywunwztvx)

It seems like you're diving deep into AWS services, particularly those related to desktop and application streaming. AppStream 2.0, Workspaces, and EC2 with DCV all offer different features and capabilities for hosting desktop environments and applications in the cloud. Your comparison matrix gives a good overview of their differences in terms of features, OS support, protocols, pricing, and more.

If you're looking to set up a solution for streaming 3D interactive applications or Android games, AWS Batch with Nice DCV could be an interesting architecture to explore, as well as using Graviton-based EC2 instances for efficient streaming.

Regarding pricing, AWS offers different options such as hourly rates, monthly rates, savings plans, and reserved instances, allowing you to choose the most cost-effective option based on your usage patterns and requirements.

It seems like you're doing thorough research into these services to find the best fit for your needs. If you have any specific questions or need further assistance with your research, feel free to ask!


## DCV CloudFormation Templates

These templates could be useful for deploying Nice DCV in Linux. There was an issue with the Windows machine where every user would need their own set of two machines. Linux allows you to do this a lot more conservatively.

## Testing

We are going to need to be able to test scaling for performance and cost measurements. I'm looking for a way to launch bots to simulate users for this purpose. This could also tie in to CI/CD, where we could run a test coverage suite to prevent bugs from being introduced into the build deployments.
