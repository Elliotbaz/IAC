# Notes

## Intro to Development Notes Docs
This is a place for the most raw of development notes. I typically create one for every day that I work and take notes on everything I do, whether it works or not. This is super handy for retracing steps later on and for getting quickly immersed when you have to pivot and come back. Taking a little bit of time to leave a trail of bread crumbs will give your future self as well as other team members insight into how your logical process works so that we can all learn from each other, from each other's experience, and all improve ourselves. The added time upfront can save countless hours of time spent repeating our own mistakes or the mistakes of others unnecessarily.

### How is this helpful?
1. Quick immersion when you need pivot and return back.
2. Learn from your past mistakes and the mistakes of others.
3. Improve your logical approach to building things and solving problems by leaving a history of steps taken.
4. Using basic Markdown makes formatting more quick and simple. It's also easier for LLMs to parse and manipulate without experiencing weird affects. Plus, you should always be more comfortable with adding Markdown files in places in your repo.
5. Enables yourself to not overthink basic docs that can be cleaned up and published to the wiki later.

### Formatting Example
I like to use the naming convention `notes-yyyymmdd.md`. 

So today, for example, I will create the file:
```bash
# docs/notes/notes-20240425.md
```

### Why use this particular naming convention?

1. This keeps you from even having to think of what to title it. Any friction that gets in the way of documenting things increases the probility that you won't. 
2. Knowing what you're going to name the file and where you're going to put it makes it much more quick and easy to get started.
3. Prevents most conflicts, so you'll be less reluctant to commit and merge your notes.
