## ENG-967 Secure Tokens & Keys
- addressables bucket is in the dev account, it's called `addressables-dev`
- aws credentials for dev are for a user called `addressables-dev` in the dev account. this user has `AmazonS3FullAccess` policy attached directly to the user.
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:*",
                "s3-object-lambda:*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Notes
- mfa is not enforced. we are not using identity center for sso, so there's no way to enforce mfa.
- kayla, mohamed and myself have all accessed the management account in the past 24 hours according to cloudtrail and none of us have mfa enabled. 
- kayla accessed the console an hour ago. no mfa. password is over a year old.
- mohamad accessed it 22 hours ago. no mfa.
- eliot also accessed the management console recently. does not have mfa enabled. has access keys too.
