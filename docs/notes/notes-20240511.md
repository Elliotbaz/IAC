# Notes | Sat, May 11

## TODO:
1. Document what we did to update the database and why. (Also, how long it took and any service disruption)
2. Start mapping out our existing infrastructure in markdown that will be used to plan and design IaC to express what's there.
3. Lay down the design of the foundational network, security, and compute architecture in which the greenfield custom render streaming will exist.
4. Document findings from Trust Advisor.
5. Add a frequent links, commands, tools and info doc under notes (or one directory higher maybe. but close to notes)


## Considerations
- make sure to include the additional Trust Advisor checks that we get access to when we upgrade our account from the lowest tier
- include information about updating the Certificate Authority in RDS
- make suggestions on how to better observe the CA date in staging in order to be optimally prepared for the production update
- make sure we have a plan for upgrading our account tier. specifically, verify that we can upgrade the management account and have it reciprocate to all of the organizational units. maybe do this from the chatbot.
