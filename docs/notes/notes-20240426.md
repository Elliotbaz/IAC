### Notes on Cost

> Today the costs for AppStream are at $89.90. 

It seems like that's a lot higher than we were expecting. However, this may still be tremendously less than Vagon. I'm making note of this so I remember to compare it day by day.

I also just noticed that someone has been running AppStream services for several months now. In fact, our monthly AppStream charges for all services are close to $1000.
